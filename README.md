## 🌟 Project Overview
Welcome to the **UTF-8 Encoding Project**! This project focuses on implementing functions to handle UTF-8 strings, including calculations for string length, comparisons, encoding, and validation. 

## 🔥 Objectives
- Develop functions to calculate the length of UTF-8 strings.
- Implement string comparison functionalities for UTF-8 encoded strings.
- Create tools for validating UTF-8 sequences.
- Encode Unicode code points into UTF-8 strings.
- Provide character access based on index within UTF-8 strings.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **C** for implementation.
- **CMake** for project configuration.
- **Git** for version control.

## 🚀 Getting Started
